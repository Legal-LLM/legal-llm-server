## 1. Introduction

Sri Lanka is a island nation boasting a population of 21.92 million people. The country's legal system is complex and diverse, reflecting the multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic, and multi-cultural nature of our society. Sri Lanka has adopted various legal systems, including Roman-Dutch and English law, both originating from common law and civil law systems introduced by foreign rulers such as the Dutch and British. The first labor law instrument was introduced in 1889, called the Estate Labor (Indian) Ordinance, No. 13 of 1889, to protect migrant labor rights in the plantation sector. During the British period, Indian immigrant workers were brought to the country to work in the plantation sector, which remains a significant contributor to Sri Lanka's export commodities, such as tea and coffee. Over time, the country has implemented many labor-related legislations, with several statutes being amended in 2021 alone. Due to its strategic geographical location, Sri Lanka has become a hotspot for international trade and investment, with the country being the first in South Asia to introduce open economic policies. In recent decades, many labor laws have been enacted to strengthen the rights and duties of employees and employers, thereby contributing to the growth of the Sri Lankan economy.

As Sri Lanka lacks a single unified labor law/code, the country's employment and labor relations are governed by a multitude of legislation (See Table: I) and working age, work hours, contracting rules, leave policies, maternity leave, minimum pay, labor taxes, and dismissal procedures are all covered by these labor laws. Even though Sri Lanka has a variety of rules and regulations, their execution has been inconsistent due to unequal application and insufficient enforcement. Furthermore, there are areas necessary under the ESS2 1 that are not regularly followed when it comes to private employment. These include issues relating to the age of employment, wages, working hours, leave and holidays,

1   The  primary  objective  of  ESS2  on  'Labor  and  Working  Conditions'  is  to  promote  sound  workermanagement relationships and enhance the development benefits of a project by treating workers in the project fairly while also providing them with safe and healthy working conditions.

maternity  protection,  occupational  safety  and  health,  industrial  relations  and  dispute  resolution, freedom of association and collective bargaining, terminal benefits etc. In such cases, the common law principles and/or judicial decisions need to be referred to for the relevant legal principles.

Sri  Lanka  has  ratified  43  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  conventions,  including  all  eight fundamental treaties on labor standards. 2 Of the 43 ILO Conventions ratified so far, 30 are in force, and ten have been ratified but not yet implemented. Three have been repealed, and three have been denounced. 3 In  addition,  four  topics  are  covered  by  the  eight  core  Conventions.  The  national mechanism has not been well laid out. These include the right to form associations and the right to free speech, the right to collective bargaining, the abolition of all kinds of forced or coercive labor, the effective implementation of international human rights treaties, the eradication of child labor, as well as the abolition of employment and occupation discrimination. Sri Lanka's government ratified the ILO convention of the 2006 Maritime Labor Convention (MLC) in January 2017. 4

## 2. Labor Laws of Sri Lanka -In Nutshell

The Constitution of Sri Lanka prohibits forced or compulsory labor directly and indirectly; Article 11 of the Constitution says that no person shall be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment  or  punishment. 5 In  addition,  Article  14  of  the  Constitution  provides  for  freedom  of association, lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprises and freedom of movement. Section 358A of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 2006 prohibits forced labor in Sri Lanka while listing several actions that can be considered forced labor. 6 Moreover, the section introduces imprisonment and fines for violating the law. If the victim is a child, more Code sections will apply. Further, the Constitution of Sri Lanka grants the right for every person to join a trade union, while

2  The eight core conventions include: The Forced Labor Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87); the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98); the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100); the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, 1957 (No. 105); the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1957 (No. 111); the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138); the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention, 1999 (No. 182)

4  This particular ILO Convention is unique in that it consolidates several pre-existing ILO Conventions on the seafarers and maritime matters, where a somewhat different process of ratification is allowed for Amendments etc.

5  Article 11 of the 1978 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

6   In addition, child trafficking is prohibited under Section 360 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 2006; Section 360 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995 (18, 19). Prohibition of commercial sexual exploitation of children is mentioned under Sections 286 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1998; Section 360 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995; and prohibition of using children in illicit activities is provided for under Section 360C of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2006; Section 288B of the Penal code (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1998.

the Trade Union Ordinance permits any seven people to form such an organisation. The number of members covered by the trade unions amounts to 9.5 per cent of the total workforce of Sri Lanka. 7

The legislation related to employee and employers' rights and duties can be categorised into seven (1)  Dispute  settlements;  (2)  Employee  remuneration;  (3)  Women  and  children  as  employees);  (4) Factory employees; (5) Employment fund other than salary and wages; (6) Employment related to foreign workers; (7) Plantation workers' rights.

## 4. Labor-related Laws and Regulations: General Overview with Recent Developments

## 4.1.  Principles

Industrialisation is the modern trend in almost all developing countries nowadays, as industry plays a vital role in shaping the economic structure of a society. Workers and employers are two pillars of our national economy. For society's planned, progressive, and purposeful development, proper regulation of the employer-employee relationship is a condition precedent. This relationship is, therefore, one of the most important factors in the success of the industrialisation programme. Labor law aims to mediate the imbalance of power between the worker and the employer; prevent the employer from dismissing the worker without good cause; to set up and preserve the processes by which workers are recognized as "equal" partners in negotiations about their working conditions etc.

Find the core principles of labor law, which was created to imbalance the power between employer and employee. Labor legislation in any country should be based upon 1) social justice, 2) social equity, 3) international  uniformity  and  4)  national  economy.  Social  justice  is  an  ideal  condition  in  which  all members  of  a  company  have  the  same  basic  rights,  security,  opportunities,  obligations  and  social benefits. Laws aim to promote the social functioning of individuals and groups and protect their rights. Social equity is based on social justice that prescribes a definite standard for adoption in future. Such a standard is forced after taking into consideration past and present circumstances. Once this standard is fixed  by  legislation,  it  cannot  be  changed  unless  the  circumstances  and  conditions  warrant  it. International uniformity is another principle on which labor laws are based. This critical role played by international  organisations  in  this  connection  is  praiseworthy.  This  organization  aims  to  secure minimum uniform standards for all labor matters. While framing the labor law, the national economy's general economic situation must be kept in mind so that objects may not be defeated.

At  the  outset,  we  can  say  that  everyone  deserves  equal  economic,  political,  and  social  rights  and opportunities. Social workers want to ensure everyone has access to opportunities, especially those who most need them. The ILO at the World Congress of the International Society of  Labor and Social Security Law reiterated the enforcement of organised labor law as one of the best paths to economic efficiency and social progress. From our point of view, the connection between fundamental principles and labor law must be upheld. The complete execution of national laws promoting equality in the workplace  has  to  be  guaranteed  by  law;  inclusionary  labor  regulation  must  prevent  increased fragmentation of the labor market; regardless of job status, all participants in the labor market must be covered by labor law. Additionally, labor laws must improve the function of labor inspection to fulfil the fundamental responsibility of safeguarding employees.

## 4.2. Recruitment

Sri  Lanka  has  ratified  all  key  conventions  related  to  labor  law,  such  as  the  International  Labor Organisation  convention  and  the  minimum  age  of  employment  and  has  sufficient  legislation  for eradicating child engagement in labor , 'hazardous' or otherwise.

For this reason, the government has decided to link the minimum age for admission to employment or work  with  the  age  of  completion  of  compulsory  schooling,  thereby  raising  the  minimum  age  of employment from 14 to 16 years. For the employment of young persons, the definition of a 'young person' has been amended to be a person who has attained the age of sixteen but is under the age of 18, whereas 'children' are defined to be persons under 16 years of age.

Accordingly, the government recently introduced  a set of laws and regulations by passing 4 Bills in Parliament on 5th January 2021 with the view of implementing the above amendments to the following 4 Acts connected to the area of employment and labor;

| Principal Enactment                                                                     | Salient Provision                                                                                                                                                                            | Amendment                                                                                                                                  |

| Employment of Women, Young Persons, and ChildrenActNo.47of1956   | A young person is described as a person who has attained the age of 14 years but is under the age of 18 years of age, whereas a 'child' is described as a person under the age of 14 years. (Section 34).   | Section 34 of the Act has been amended to describe a young person as a person between theagesof16and18 by increasing the minimum employment age of young persons to 16 years of age. A 'child' is described as a person under the age of 16, and the age of a person attending elementary school has also been amended to be increased to 16 years. (section 34 of Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children ActNo2of 2021) Accordingly, section 3, section 9 and section 20 of the principal might have been amended to be on par with the above new definition of a young person and a child.   |

However, there is an exception to the abovementioned law. A child under the age of 16 is not prevented from getting involved in agri-business activities of his family or any business activity organised for an educational/charitable purpose, provided such partaking is done only before or after the commencement of school.

## 4.3. Termination

Regulation of the termination by employers of the scheduled employments of workmen is discussed in this  section. Section 2 (1) of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provision) Act (TEWA) No 20 of 2008 stipulated that no employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workman without the prior consent in writing of the workman; or the prior written approval of the Commissioner.  There  are  some  grounds  under  which  the  Commissioner  could  grant  or  refuse  his approval to an employer to terminate the scheduled employment of any workman. Find the following grounds for approval or refusal as per section 2(1) of the TEWA:

- (a)  such  approval  may  be  granted  or  refused  on  the  application  on  that  behalf  made  by  such employer; a copy of which application shall be served on the workman concerned, who shall be afforded an opportunity of being heard;
- (b) the Commissioner may, in his absolute discretion, decide to grant or refuse such approval;
- (c) the Commissioner shall grant or refuse such approval within three months from the date of receipt of an application on that behalf made by such employer;
- (d) the Commissioner shall give notice in writing of his decision on the application to both the employer and the workman;
- (e) the Commissioner may, in his absolute discretion, decide the terms and conditions subject to which his approval should be granted, including any particular terms and conditions relating to  the  payment  by  such  employer  to  the  workman  of  a  gratuity  or  compensation  for  the termination of such employment; and
- (f) any decision made by the Commissioner under the preceding provisions of this subsections shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question whether by way of writ or otherwise -  (i)  in  any  court,  or  (ii)  in  any  court,  tribunal  or  other  institution  established  under  the Industrial Disputes Act.

When the Commissioner receives an application under subsection (2), it is his responsibility to notify the affected workers within three days of receiving the application and request that they respond to it within seven days of receiving it. However, if the worker fails to respond within the above time frame, the Commissioner may grant an additional period of time not to exceed seven days upon his being notified of the failure.

Any person who fails to comply with any decision made by the Commissioner under subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on conviction after trial before a Magistrate, be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.

The scheduled employment of any worker shall be deemed to have been terminated by his employer if, for  any  reason  other  than  due  to  a  sanction  imposed  by  way  of  disciplinary  action,  his  employer terminates the services of such worker in such employment. Such termination shall be deemed to include -  non-employment  of  the  workman  in  such  employment  by  his  employer,  whether  temporarily  or permanently, or non-employment of the workman in such employment in consequence of the closure by  his  employer  of  any  trade,  industry  or  business.  Where  any  employer  terminates  the  scheduled employment of any workman by reason of punishment imposed by way of disciplinary action, the

employer shall notify such workman in writing of the reasons for the termination of employment before the expiry of the second working day after the date of such termination.

Termination of scheduled employment of a workman in contravention of this Act is to be null and void as per section 5 of the TEWA. Section 6 deals with the Power of Commissioner to issue orders and the duty of employers to comply with such orders. Section 6(A) stipulated that if an employer terminates a worker's scheduled employment in violation of this Act's provisions, the Commissioner may order that employer to pay the worker's wages and provide all other benefits that the worker would have otherwise received if his services had not been terminated in that manner, and to continue working with the worker in the same capacity as before the date specified in the order. The Commissioner will arrange for notice of the order to be given to the employer and the employee. However, as per section 6 (B) (1), no order is to be made after six months of applying the workman's application and the right to seek other legal remedies.

Section  6  (C) provides  that,  'w here  the  Commissioner  orders  any  sum  of  money  to  be  paid  to  a workman under section 6 or section 6A of this Act, the Magistrate's Court having jurisdiction in the area where such workman is or was employed by his employer shall, if satisfied on the written petition of such workman that payment of such money has not been made within the time specified in that behalf by the Commissioner, make order that amount of such money shall be paid by such employer to such workman and that such amount if not paid in compliance with the order, be recovered in like manner as a fine imposed by the Court, and the amount so recovered shall be paid to such workman .'

As per section 7 of TEWA, ' where an employer fails to comply with an order made under section 6 or section 6A, such employer shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate to imprisonment of either description for a term of not less than six months and not exceeding two years. ' Moreover, Section 17 of TEWA states that, ' the proceedings at  any  inquiry  held  by  the  Commissioner  for  the  purposes  of  this  Act  may  be  conducted  by  the Commissioner in  any  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the  principles  of  natural  justice,  which  to  the Commissioner may seem best adapted to elicit proof or information concerning matters that arise at such inquiry. '

## 4.4. Retirement

T he Minimum Retirement Age of Workers Act, No. 28 of 2021 ('MRAW Act') provide  a  legally binding minimum retirement age, which is also applicable to private sectors. Most employers operate based on contractual agreements in terms of age of retirement and may vary as per the employment

contract. However, the above Act brings minimum retirement age in respect of the private sector for the first time. Section 2 of the above Act provides that;

' Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, a contract of service, collective agreement or any other form of a contract of service, the minimum retirement age of a worker who has not attained the age of fifty-two years on the date of operation of this Act or who is recruited after the date of coming into operation of this Act shall be upon such worker attaining the age of sixty years (hereinafter referred to as the 'minimum retirement age'):

Provided that the minimum retirement age of a worker who has reached the age of fifty-two years or above, on the date of coming into operation of this Act, shall be deemed to be the age as specified in Schedule I.

## Schedule I refers as follows;

| Age of worker as at the date of coming into operation of the Minimum Retirement Age of Workers Act   |   Minimum Retirement Age |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 54 years or above and below 55 years                                                                 |                       57 |
| 53 years or above and below 54 years                                                                 |                       58 |
| 52 years or above and below 53 years                                                                 |                       59 |
| Below 52 years                                                                                       |                       60 |
| Anemployee recruited on or after the operative date of theMRAWAct.                                   |                       60 |

Section 3 brings certain restrictions on premature retirement, accordingly, the section states that 'a ny employer who employs fifteen or more workers shall not retire any worker  other than the workers specified in Schedule II, and any worker engaged in any trade or occupation as shall be prescribed by regulation, from time to time, in keeping with the nature of the work until such worker attains the minimum retirement age .' However, in certain circumstances, premature retirement is allowed on a certain ground as per the contract of service or collective agreement.

- a) where  any  registered  medical  practitioner  has  certified  that  a  worker  is  permanently incapacitated of engaging in work due to some sickness;

- b) where the service of a worker has been terminated as a result of any disciplinary inquiry and the decision of such termination has not been revised by law;
- c) upon closure or the destruction of an establishment due to any natural cause; or
- d) with the prior written approval of the Commissioner General under the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971.

The provisions of subsection (1) shall not apply to any employer who has employed fifteen workers or less  than  that on  an average within the twelve months period prior to the retirement of any worker (section  2).  Similarly,  any  worker  who  wishes  on  his  own  to  vacate  his  job  prior  to  the  minimum retirement age may on his own do so (section 3).

No contract of service can be formed in contrary to the provisions of this Act and shall be void as per section  4.    Any  workers  who  have  been  prematurely  terminated  by  the  employer  such  workers  can comply with the Commissioner -General within two months from the date of such retirement (section 5).  However, section 5(4) stipulates that 'w here any worker has prior to coming into operation of this Act made a complaint in terms of the Industrial Disputes Act (Chapter 131) or the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No.45 of 1971 to the Commissioner-General, a Labor  Tribunal,  an  arbitrator  or  an  Industrial  Court  against  premature  retirement  and  a  final determination has not been made on such complaint by the Commissioner-General, Labor Tribunal, arbitrator or Industrial Court, the Commissioner-General has no power to inquire into a complaint made under this Act .' If an employer is dissatisfied with a decision of the Commissioner-General made under section 5 may make an application to the Court of Appeal against such decision.

Part IV of the above Act lists the offences and penalties, accordingly, Sections 11 and 12 provide that 'a ny employer who contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) of section 3 commits an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment. ' Similarly, as per section 12, if an employer ' fails  to  comply with a direction specified in the notice issued by the Commissioner-General under section 5, commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction after summary trial by a Magistrate to a fine, not less than five thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment .' All offences under this Act must be tried summarily by a Magistrate court.

## 4.4. . Working Hours and Overtime

The Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act No 19 of 1954 ('SOEA') section  3  provides  the  common  time  period  of  employment  (exclusive  of  rest  and  meal breaks) will be as follows:

- A time period that does not go beyond eight hours a day
- A time period that does not go beyond 45 hours a week

The worker is allowed a meal or rest break of half of an hour at the expiration of any period of four hours of continuous employment, which is commonly translated into a meal and rest break of an hour each day. No meal or rest break will be permissible if the employee is not working for over five hours on any given day.

Therefore, the SOEA and the Regulations requirements do not apply to any individual employed in or regarding the trade of an office or shop as a travelling salesperson, investigator, supervisor, manager or in any related faculty. Consequently, as per Section 3 (1) of the SOEA, such workers may be obligated to  work  more  than  eight  hours  a  day  and/or  45  hours  per  week  devoid  of  any  overtime  claim. Conversely, such workers will be permitted to have weekly holidays, as stated by the SOEA.

In  general  practice,  female  administrative  staff  who  are  occupied  during  work  hours  infringe  such limitations exclusive of permit provided that sufficient amenities are offered, such as meals, travelling, etc. The provisions of section 3 (1) ' shall not apply to any person who holds an executive or managerial position in a public institution and is in receipt of a consolidated salary, the initial of the scale of which is  not  less  than  Rs.6,720  per  annum.  Where  any  question  arises  as  to  whether  any  person  holds  an executive or managerial position, the Commissioner and his decision shall be final and conclusive. '

The Factories Ordinance (Chapter 128) No 45 of 1942, as amended recently in 2021, section 67 has been made to broaden the choice of hours that a young person could work within a day.  Accordingly, a young person's employment period (young person as a person between the ages of 16 and 18)  shall not exceed 12 hours on any day (between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.), and on one day in the week, work hours shall end by 1 p.m.

The Cabinet has approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment to amend the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration Act No 19 of 1954). In August 2022, the Ministry of Labor took steps to amend the laws so that school children between the ages of 16 and 20 can be recruited for part-time employment in private companies. It has been decided to allow the youth of this age to do part-time jobs for 20 hours per month.

## 4.5. Wages and Legal Allowances

## (a) Minimum Wage:

Minimum wages are 'the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract. ' 15

National Minimum Wage of Workers Act No 3 of 2016 specifies that the minimum monthly wage for all employees (irrespective of industry) is LKR 10,000, and the minimum daily wage is LKR 400. In 2021,  the  National  Minimum Wage of Workers (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2021, amended the previous amount and stipulated in Section 03 of the act as 'the national minimum monthly wage for all workers  in  any  industry  or  service  shall  be  twelve  thousand  five  hundred  rupees  and  the  national minimum daily wage of a worker shall be five hundred rupees'.

## (b) Action against default of payment of the national minimum wage:

The Commissioner-General follows some procedures for any default in the payment of minimum wages as per Section 08 of the National Minimum Wage of Workers Act No 3 of 2016. After an investigation, if  the  Commissioner-General  determines  that  an  employer  has  failed  to  pay  the  national  minimum monthly or daily wage due to any worker or workers, he may order the employer to deposit with him the amount of the portion of the national minimum monthly or daily wage that is defaulted in respect of such worker or workers for the time the failure to pay occurred. Employers have the responsibility to deposit  with  the  Commissioner-General  the  amount  indicated  in  the  notice  on  or  before  the  date specified in the notice.

The Commissioner-General shall issue a certificate containing details of the sum so due and the name and address of the defaulting employer to the Magistrate having jurisdiction in the division in which the place of employment of the worker or workers in respect of whom default is made when an employer fails to make the payment of any sum he is required to pay as the national minimum monthly or daily wage under this Act and violates subsection (2) of section 8. The Magistrate's proceedings will thereafter be followed.

## (c) Penalties for non-compliance:

National Minimum Wages Act No 3 of 2016 specifically provides that any employer in any industry or service who contravenes the provisions of section 3 16 or section 4 17 or section 8 18 of this Act shall be

15   ILO: General Survey concerning the Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 (No. 131) , and the Minimum Wage Fixing Recommendation, 1970 (No. 135) , Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, 2014

16  National minimum wage, s 3 of National Minimum Wages Act No 16 of 2021

17  Special provisions regarding continuation of employment, s 4 of National Minimum Wages Act No 3 of 2016

18  Action against default of payment of the national minimum wage, s 8 of National Minimum Wages Act No 3 of 2016

guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction by a Magistrate to a fine not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.

## (d) Allowance

A  form  of  payment  paid  at  the  company's  discretion  or  to  contribute  towards  the  expenses  of  an employee. It is typically negotiated into the employment contract. Some common types of allowances include vehicle allowances, housing allowances, or travel allowances. A law to provide for the payment of  special  allowances  by  employers  to  certain  categories  of  workers  is  dealt  with  by  the  Special Allowances of Workers Act No 17 of 1978 (SAW Act). The Commissioner shall be the competent authority for the purposes of this Law, and the competent authority may delegate to any officer of the Department of Labor any power, function or duty conferred or imposed on such authority by this Law.

Every employer in any trade who employs a worker whose monthly earnings do not exceed Rs. 800 shall pay the worker an allowance for each month based on the following formula [section 3, SAW Act].

- (a) When a worker is paid monthly, the allowance must equal at least 20% of the earnings or salary that is owed to that worker for the given month.
- (b) For a worker who is paid daily, the allowance must equal at least 20% of the daily wage that should have been provided to that person for each day of the month.
- (c) When a worker is paid on a piece-rate basis, the allowance that is granted must equal at least 20% of the earnings that are owed to him at that rate each month.

However, the allowance payable under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) shall not, in any case, exceed fifty rupees. Suppose a worker's monthly earnings total more than eight hundred rupees but less than eight hundred and fifty rupees. In that case, their employer is required to pay them an allowance each month that is equal to the difference between eight hundred and fifty rupees and the amount they received in salary or wages for that month.

In case of a non-recurring Cost of Living Gratuity determined in accordance with, or in light of, the terms of any Collective Agreement or in accordance with an Order issued by the Minister pursuant to section  10(2)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  or  a  Cost-of-Living  Allowance  based  on  the  Colombo Consumers' Price Index is paid to the workers; the employer may deduct from the amount payable to such works as such gratuity or such allowance as follows;

- (a) where the total earnings of such worker for the month do not exceed four hundred rupees, an amount equivalent to ten per centum of the salary or wages of such worker or a sum of thirty rupees, whichever is less; and

- (b) where the total earnings exceed four hundred rupees, a sum of fifty rupees.

Payment of additional allowance is stated in section 4 of the SAW Act. Every employer, in any trade, of a worker whose total earnings for the month do not exceed eight hundred rupees, shall pay to the such worker in respect of each month, in addition to the allowance referred to in section 3, an allowance which is not less than twenty-five rupees. It is further provided that [S 4(1)];

- (a) If such an employer is bound by a collective bargaining agreement published in Gazette No. 14,975 of September 10, 1971, or by an order made pursuant to section 10(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act with respect to such a collective bargaining agreement, or if such an employer pays wages and nonrecurring cost of living gratuities that are not less favourable than the amounts payable under any such collective bargaining agreement, voluntarily or otherwise, the allowance payable shall be ten per cent (10%) of such amount.
- (b) The allowance payable shall be 10% of the amount payable to such worker as wages for the number of days he or she has worked during the month, at the rate of the daily minimum wage payable for the industry in which such employer is engaged in the growing and manufacturing of tea, rubber, cocoa, cardamom, and pepper, or the growing and manufacturing of coconuts, cinnamon, or tobacco.

When a worker is paid on a piece-rate or daily-rate basis, the allowance payable must equal at least 10% of  the  wages  paid  on  a  piece-rate  or  daily-rate  basis.  However,  the  allowance  payable  under  this subsection may not be more than 25% per mensem [section 4 (2)]. When a person paid monthly does not work the required number of days as specified by any written law or contract, for any reason other than the employer failing to give them work to do, the allowance due to that person will be proportional to  the  number  of  days  that  person  has  worked  during  the  month  [section  4(3)].  Each  month,  an employer who employs a worker whose total monthly earnings are greater than eight hundred rupees but less than eight hundred and seventy-five rupees must pay the worker an allowance equal to the difference between eight hundred and seventy-five rupees and the amount the worker received as salary or wages for that month [section 4(4)].

Despite the preceding provisions of this section, the allowance determined under subsection (1) shall not be payable to a worker;

- (a) to whom Collective Agreement No. 5 of 1967 applies;
- (b) to whom the employer, voluntarily or otherwise, pays wages and a nonrecurring Cost of Living Gratuity which are not less favourable than the amount payable under the Collective Agreement referred to in paragraph (a);

- (c) to whom the employer pays a Cost-of-Living Allowance determined in accordance with the Colombo Consumers' Price Index;
- (d) who is employed in an institution declared to be an approved charity under section 16A of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 4 of 1963, or section 31 (9) (a) of the Inland Revenue Act (No. 28 of 1979), as the case may be; and
- (e) whose employer is bound by an Order under section 10 (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, in respect of any Collective Agreement published in Gazette No. 14,975 of September 10, 1971, and pays wages and a non-recurring Cost of Living Gratuity in terms of any such agreement, where the total number of workers employed by such employer is less than twenty-five.

## e) Over Time

The Shop and Office Employees Act, Sec 6-9, deals with the payment for overtime. Overtime in relation to  any  employment  or  work  means  employment  or  work  in  excess  of  the  regular  working  hours. Overtime shall not exceed an aggregate of 12 hours in any one week.

No employee is required to work overtime unless he is paid separately for such overtime work in respect of  each  hour,  at  a  rate  not  less  than  1.5  times  the  hourly  rate  of  his  ordinary  remuneration.  The remuneration payable for any part of an hour of overtime work he does shall be determined in the proportion that part bears to the hour.

The  hourly  rate  of  remuneration  for  the  purpose  of  computing  overtime  remuneration  shall  be  as follows -

- where remuneration is payable at a daily rate, be one-eighth of the daily rate,
- where remuneration is payable at a monthly rate, be one-eighth of the monthly rate divided by thirty,
- where remuneration is payable at a fortnightly rate, be one-eighth of the monthly rate divided by fourteen, and,
- where remuneration is payable at a weekly rate, be one-eighth of the monthly rate divided by seven.

In order to compute overtime in respect of work done in any week by any employee in excess of the normal maximum period of 45 hours, any day in that week on which such employee was on leave or holiday shall be deemed to be a day on which such employee had worked for the normal maximum period fixed for a day.

## 4.6. Vacation / Holidays

## (a) Weekly Holidays (section 05 of the Shop and Office Employees Act)

Regulations of the SOEA state that a member of staff who works for fewer than 28 hours (exclusive of breaks and overtime) in any one week should be permitted one and half days of paid holidays in that week or the week that follows immediately after that. Usually, such weekly holidays are given as a half day on Saturday and a complete day on Sunday. It is also ordinary for most organizations to offer a complete  holiday  on  Saturday.  Any  worker  who  is  necessitated  to  week  on  any  weekly  holiday  is permitted to a sum at the overtime amount in agreement with the procedure illustrated above.

## (b) Constitutional Holidays

Shop and Office workers are permitted a salaried holiday on all constitutional holidays. Presently, such holidays are as below:

- Tamil Thai Pongal
- National Day
- Milad-UnNabi (Holy Prophet's Birthday)
- The day preceding the Sinhala and Tamil New Year
- Sinhala and Tamil New Year Day
- May Day
- Day subsequent to the Vesak Full Moon Poya Day
- Christmas Day

As mentioned by the stringent application of the SOEA, the consent of the Commissioner of Labor is mandatory for an office or shop member of staff to work on a constitutional holiday. Nevertheless, in general  practice,  in  the  event  where  a  member  of  the  staff  works  on  a  constitutional  holiday,  such workers are given a substitute holiday on any day before the 31 st of December of that said year or salaried in an additional day's income.

## (c) Poya Days and Mercantile Holidays (section 7 of the SOEA)

All workers are permitted a holiday on a full moon Poya day. Nonetheless, a worker could be engaged in work on such a day, given that the said employee is paid no less than one and a half times the typical daily salary. If a mercantile holiday or Poya day falls on a constitutional holiday or what is habitually a full or half weekly holiday, a substitute holiday does not need to be granted in lieu.

## (d) Annual Holiday/Leave (section 6 of the SOEA)

An office or shop worker is permitted 14 days of yearly leave, complete with the full salary for each concluded year of service. The SOEA entails that no fewer than seven days be permitted on such basis in value of the first year of service that a worker is permitted a fair leave calculated below.

- Fourteen days if service began on or after the 1 st of January but before the 1 st of April.
- Ten days if service began or no after the first of April but before the 1 st of July.
- Seven days if service began or not after the 1 st of July but before the 1 st of October.
- Four days of service began or no after the 1 st of October but before the 31 st of December.

Besides the annual leave, an office or shop worker will be permitted seven days of informal leave in respect of every calendar year. Informal leave for the initial year of service can be taken on the foundation of one day for every concluded period of two months of service.

The maximum annual leave or holiday claims for workers in the building industry will be one holiday for  every  unit  of  18  days  the  employee  has  worked  (maximum  operational  days  will  be  252)  and  a maximum of 14 days.

For workers in the engineering industry, a maximum of 14 days' holidays with seven days to be taken successively.

## (f) Maternity Leave

Under section 18 of SOEA No 14 of 2018, for the birth of an employee's first child, or where the employee already has one child and for the birth of the second child, the employee is permitted 84 days of paid leave. Such leave can be availed of 14 days pre-confinement leave and 70 days post-confinement leave.

Female workers not covered by the SOEA will be covered by the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No 32 of 1939 (MBO). In the event of females covered under the MBO, the leave entitlement allotted for the first and second child is a total of 12 weeks (superseding non-working days to be included).

The leave entitlement for the third child or subsequent child, or deceased child, or viable foetus is six weeks (intervening non-working days to be included). If a female passes away during her maternity leave, the leave in respect of which payment must be made is only up to and including the date of her death.

## 4.7. . Industrial Health and Welfare

## (a) Cleanliness

Section 6 of the Factories Ordinance states that every factory shall be kept in a clean state and free from effluvia  arising  from  any  drain,  sanitary  convenience  or  nuisance,  and,  without  prejudice  to  the generality of the;

- (a) accumulations of dirt and refuse shall be removed daily by a suitable method from the floors and benches of workrooms and from the staircases and passages;
- (b) the floor of every workroom shall be cleaned at least once in every week by washing or, if it is effective and suitable, by sweeping or other method;
- (c)  all  such  measures as may be prescribed by regulation shall be taken to keep in a clean and sanitary condition all inside walls and partitions and all ceilings or tops of rooms and all walls, sides and tops of passages and staircases:

However, there are some exceptions to the aforementioned standards. For example, any regulations made under paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply to any factory where mechanical power is not used, and there are fewer than ten employees unless the District Factory Inspecting Engineer in any case otherwise requires; and when it appears to the Commissioner that any of the aforementioned provisions of this section are not necessary for the purpose of keeping the factory in a clean state, are due to special circumstances inappropriate, or are insufficient for such purpose, he may, if he thinks fit, by order direct that those provisions shall not apply to factories.

## (b) Overcrowding

Section 7 of the Factories Ordinance stipulates that, while work is carried out, a factory shall not be so overcrowded as to cause risk of injury to the health of the persons employed therein. Anyways, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, a factory shall be deemed to be so overcrowded as aforesaid if the number of persons employed at a time in any workroom is such that the amount of cubic space allowed for each person employed in the room is less than four hundred cubic feet.

If the Chief Factory Inspecting Engineer believes that where explosive materials are manufactured or handled would be inappropriate or unnecessary, he may, by certificate, exempt the workroom from the aforesaid provisions subject to any conditions specified in the certificate.

As respects any room used as a workroom at the appointed date, the last foregoing provision shall, for the period of five years after that date and, if before the expiration of that period effective and suitable mechanical ventilation has been provided in the room, for a further period of five years, have effect as if for the reference therein to four hundred cubic feet there were substituted a reference to two hundred and fifty cubic feet.

Find the exceptions to the foregoing provisions. The aforesaid conditions shall cease to apply to the room -

- (a) if the room passes into the occupation of any person other than the person who was the occupier thereof at the appointed date, or his successor in the same business; or
- (b) if, during the first of the said periods, the District Factory Inspecting Engineer requires the provision of effective and suitable mechanical ventilation in the room and default is made in complying with the requirement; or
- (c)  if,  during  the  second  of  the  said  periods  or  in  a  case  where  it  has  been  provided  in pursuance of the Factory Inspecting Engineer's requirement during either of those periods, the  effective  and  suitable  mechanical  ventilation  provided  in  the  room  ceases  to  be maintained.

## (c) Regulations increasing the amount of cubic space allowance for each person .

As per section 8 of the FO, the Minister may make regulations as to any class or description of factory or parts thereof or any process, increasing the number of cubic feet which must under section 7 be allowed for every person employed in a workroom of a factory.

## (d) Calculation of the amount of cubic space in the room.

For the purposes of calculating the amount of cubic space in any room as per section 7, no space more than fourteen feet from the floor shall be taken into account, and where a room contains a gallery, the gallery shall be treated for the purposes of section 7 as if it were partitioned off from the remainder of the room and formed a separate room. This has been stated in section 8 of the FO.

## (e) Notice of the number of persons employed to be posted in each workroom.

Section 10 of the FO stipulates that, unless the District Factory Inspecting Engineer otherwise directs, a notice shall be posted in each workroom in a factory stating the number of persons who, having regard to the provisions of section 7, may be employed in that room.

## (f) Temperature

Effective measures must be taken to secure and maintain a comfortable temperature in each workroom, as has been discussed in section 11 of the FO. But no technique may be used that causes any fumes to escape into the air of a workroom in a manner that is likely to endanger or offend those who work there.

The Minister may, by regulations, prescribe a standard of reasonable temperature (which may vary from the standard prescribed by the last preceding subsection for sedentary work) for factories or for any class or description of factory or parts thereof and may also prohibit the use of any methods of maintaining a  reasonable  temperature  that,  in  the  Minister's  judgement,  are  likely  to  be  harmful  to  the  people employed, and direct that thermometers shall be provided and maintained.

## (g) Ventilation

Section  12  of  the  FO  provides,  effective  and  suitable  provision  shall  be  made  for  securing  and maintaining by the circulation of fresh air in each workroom the adequate ventilation of the room and for rendering harmless, so far as practicable, all fumes, dust and other impurities injurious to health that may be generated in the course of any process or work carried on in the factory. The Minister may, by regulations, prescribe a standard of adequate ventilation for factories or for any class or description of factory or parts thereof.

## (h) Lighting

Section 13 of FO provides that in any area of a plant where people are working or passing through, enough and proper illumination, whether natural or artificial, should be secured and maintained. (2) The Minister may prescribe by regulations a standard of  adequate and appropriate illumination for factories, for any kind or category of factory, or any portion of a factory, or for any process. (3) Nothing in the aforementioned provisions of this section or any rules issued thereunder will be interpreted as allowing prescriptions or other orders to be made regarding the production of any artificial lighting by any specific illuminant. As much as is practical, all glass windows and skylights used to light workrooms must  be  maintained  clean  on  both  the  inside  and  outside  and  free  of  obstructions.  However,  this paragraph does not apply to the whitewashing or darkening of windows and skylights done to reduce heat or glare.

## (i) Drainage of Floors

Section 14 of the FO stipulates that where any process is carried on which renders the floor liable to be wet to such an extent that the wet is capable of being removed by drainage, effective means shall be provided and maintained for draining off the wet.

## (j) Sanitary conveniences

Section 15 states that ' sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences for the persons employed in the factory shall be provided, maintained and kept clean, and effective provision shall be made for lighting the conveniences and where persons of both sexes are or are intended to be employed such conveniences shall afford proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. The Minister may make regulations determining  for  factories  or  for  any  class  or  description  of  factory  what  is  sufficient  and  suitable provision for the purposes of this section. '

## 4.8. Industrial Accidents

The Industrial Safety Division functions under the Department of Labor, Ministry of Labor, Sri Lanka. The main objective of the division is to ensure Safety, Health and Welfare at each and every work place by enforcing the Factories Ordinance No 45 of 1942 with subsequent amendments and many other regulations  enacted  subsequently.  The  occupati onal  safety  and  health  and  payment  of  workmen's compensation is dealt with through Factories Ordinance and Workmen's Compensation Ordinance and its subsequent amendments and regulations. The services provided by the industrial safety division are decentralised through ten District factory inspection Engineer's offices at Anuradhapura, Badulla, Colombo, Gampaha, Galle, Jaffna, Kaluthara, Kandy, Kurunegala and Ratnapura.

Following are related documents (Forms) available with regard to industrial safety.

Section  03  of  the  Workmen's  Compensation  Ordinance  provides  an  employer's  liability  to  pay compensation for injury suffered by a workman. ' If personal injury is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance: Provided that the employer shall not be so liable in respect of any injury which does not result in the total or partial disablement of the workman for a period exceeding three days; in respect of any injury, not resulting in death, caused by an accident which is directly attributable to -

- (i) the workman having been at the time thereof under the influence of drink or drugs, or
- (ii) the wilful disobedience of the workman to an order expressly given, or to a rule expressly framed, for the purpose of securing the safety of workmen, or
- (iii) the wilful removal or disregard by the workman of any safety guard or other device which he knew to have been provided for the purpose of securing the safety of workmen. '

## (a) Employer's liability to pay compensation for certain diseases contracted by a workman

Section  04  of  the  Workman  Compensation  Ordinance  provides  that ' if  a  workman  contracts  an occupational disease described in the first column of Part A of Schedule III whilst he is employed in any process  described  in  the  corresponding  entry  in  the  second  column  of  that  Part  or  contracts  an occupational disease described in the first column of Part B of the aforesaid Schedule whilst he is in the service of an employer in whose service he has been employed for a continuous period of not less than six months in any process described in the corresponding entry in the second column of that Part, the contracting of the disease shall be deemed to be an injury by accident within the meaning of section 3, and unless the employer proves the contrary, the accident shall be deemed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. For these purposes, a period of service shall be deemed to be continuous, which has not included a period of service under any other employer. '

## (b) Circumstances in which compensation is payable in respect of any disease.

Section 05 of the Workman Compensation Ordinance provides that ' no compensation shall be payable to a workman in respect of any disease unless the disease is directly attributable to a specific injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment or the disease is reasonably attributable to the nature of his employment. '

## (c) Compensation

Section  06  of  the  Workman  Compensation  Ordinance  stipulates  the  method  the  amount  of compensation shall be provided; ' Where death results from the injury and the deceased was a workman in receipt of monthly wages falling within limits shown in the first column of Schedule IV - the amount shown against such limits in the second column thereof: Where permanent total disablement results from the injury, and the disabled work man was in receipt of monthly wages falling within limits shown in the first column of Schedule IV - the amount shown against such limits in the third column thereof; and Where permanent partial disablement results from the injury - (i) in the case of an injury specified in  Schedule  I,  such  percentage  of  the  compensation  which  would have been  payable in  the  case  of permanent total disablement as is specified therein as being the percentage of the loss of earning capacity caused by that injury, and (ii) in the case of an injury not specified in Schedule I, such percentage of the

compensation payable in the case of permanent total disablement as is proportionate to the loss of earning capacity permanently caused by the injury. '

They provided that in a case where more injuries than one is ' caused by the same accident, the amount of compensation payable under this head shall be aggregated but not so in any case as to exceed the amount which would have been payable if permanent total disablement had resulted from the injuries. Where temporary disablement, whether total or partial, results from the injury, a half-monthly payment payable on the sixteenth day from the date of the disablement, and thereafter half-monthly during the disablement or during a period of five years, whichever period is shorter, in the case of a workman in receipt of monthly wages falling within limits shown in the first column of Schedule IV - of the sum shown against such limits in the fourth column thereof provided. '

The  amount  of  any  payment  or  allowance  that  the  workman  has  received  from  the  employer  as compensation during the period of disability prior to receiving such a lump sum or of the first halfmonthly payment, as the case may be, shall be deducted from any lump sum or half-monthly payments to which the workman is entitled. No half-monthly payment shall, in any case, exceed the amount, if any, by which half the amount of the workman's monthly wages.

The amount fixed by agreement between the workman and his employer or, in the absence of such agreement, the amount determined by the Commissioner as a fair rental of the premises for the period of  such  occupation  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  received  if  the  workman  occupies  any  premises provided by or belonging to his employer for all or any portion of the period of disability referred to in paragraph (a) of this proviso without being paid rent for such occupation.

If  the  disablement  ends  before  the  day  on  which  any  half-monthly  payment  is  due,  an  amount equivalent to the length of the disablement in that half-month is due for that half-month. The term "monthly wages", as used in this section, does not bar any worker from receiving compensation under this ordinance simply because he is not paid at a monthly rate or because his pay is based on time worked, work completed, or at a daily rate.

## 5. Trade Union

Trade unions and organizations play a crucial role in  advocating for  and  safeguarding  labor-related rights,  addressing  various labor issues  such  as  favorable  working conditions, minimum wages, equal remuneration, equal opportunities for promotions, non-discrimination, working hours, and holidays. They  serve  as  the  voice  of  employees  and  contribute  to  economic  development.  Internationally,

numerous instruments emphasize labor standards, treating labor rights as human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), specifically Article 23, outlines rights such as the right to work, free choice of employment, just and favorable conditions of work, protection against unemployment, equal pay for equal work, just and fair remuneration, and the right to form and join trade unions.

Additionally,  Article  22.1  of  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights  (ICCPR) recognizes the right to freedom of association, including the right to form and join trade unions. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) similarly acknowledges the  right  to  form  and  join  trade  unions.  Several  core  conventions  of  the  International  Labor Organization  (ILO)  incorporate  provisions  related  to  labor  rights,  encompassing  the  formation, creation, and association with other labor unions or organizations. In Sri Lanka, the primary legislation governing the registration of trade unions is the Trade Unions Ordinance No. 14 of 1935, amended in 1948, 1918, and 197, which addresses the registration and control of trade unions.  Ordinance section 2 defines 'trade Union'' accordingly,

'Trade Union' means any association or combination of workmen or employers, whether permanent or temporary, having among its objects one or more of the following objects:

- a) the regulation of relations between workmen and employers, or between workmen and workmen or between employers and employers; or
- b) the imposing of restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business; or
- c) the representation of either workmen or employers in trade disputes; or
- d) the promotion or organisation or financing of strikes or lock-outs in any trade or industry or  the  provision  of  pay  or  other  benefits  for  its  members  during  a  strike  or  lock-out,  and includes any federation of two or more trade unions. '

Section 8 (2) of the Ordinance makes it mandatory to register trade unions within a period of three months reckoned from the date on which it was so established. As per Sec 9 (1), ' every application for registration of a trade union shall be made to the Registrar in the prescribed form and shall be signed by at least seven members of the union, any of whom may be officers thereof. ' If the Registrar is satisfied with the application, they should register the union as per section 10.  Following the registration, a certificate  will  be  issued.  If,  in  any  case,  one  of  the  objects  of  such  a  trade  union  is  unlawful,  the registration of the trade union shall be void.   Section 15 lists how certification of registration of a trade

union may be withdrawn or cancelled by the Registrar. Section 16. (1) ' any persons aggrieved by the refusal of the Registrar to register a trade union or by an order made by the Registrar under section 15 may appeal against such refusal or order by filing a petition of appeal in the District Court within a period of thirty days reckoned from the date of such refusal or order. '' As per section 17, ' an appeal shall  lie  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  against  an  order  made  by  a  District  Court  under  section  16;  the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code shall apply accordingly in all matters relating to or connected with such appeal. '

Members of the trade unions include members above the age of sixteen (section 31).  Further provides that 'n ot less than one-half of the total number of the officers of every registered trade union shall be persons  actually  engaged  or  employed  in  an  industry  or  occupation  with  which  the  trade  union  is connected ' (S. 32(1)). The registered trade union's name may be changed with the consent of two -thirds of  its  total  membership  (S.  33),  or  any  two  or  more  registered  unions  can  amalgamate  (S.34). Nevertheless, the notice of changes should be given in writing to the Registrar (S. 35(1).

The consequences of failure to register, withdrawal, or cancellation of registration are listed in section 18 of the Ordinance. Accordingly, it will consider unlawful association and cease to enjoy any of the rights, immunities, or privileges of a registered trade union. Moreover, unregistered trade unions cannot participate in any trade dispute, promote, organise or finance any strike or lock-out. Such unions shall be dissolved. The rights and liabilities of trade unions are mentioned under Part V of the Ordinance. Accordingly, A trade union shall not enjoy any of the rights, immunities or privileges of a registered trade union until it is registered.' (S.25); Immunity from civil action. (S.26); Immunity for the tortious act. (S.27); liability in the contract. (S.28); A registered trade union may sue or be sued. (S.30(1)).

Sri Lankan adopts international standards on labor rights and particularly on trade unions. The 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution, Article 14(1)(d), ensures freedom to form and join a trade union. However, fundamental rights embodied in Article 14 are subject to limitation. Article 15(7) states that;

The exercise and operation of all the fundamental rights declared and recognised by Articles 12,13 (1), 13 (2) and 14 shall be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the interests of national security, public order and protection of public health or morality, or for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms  of  others,  or  of  meeting  the  just  requirements  of  the  general  welfare  of  a democratic society. For the purpose of this paragraph, 'law' includes regulations made under the law for the time being relating to public security.

The Industrial Dispute Act also recognised the formation of trade unions in Sri Lanka. This Act was amended in 1999 and 2011. As per the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, No. 56 of 1999, Part VA includes unfair labor practices by an employer. Section 32 A provides that;

## No employer shall -

- a. require a workman to join, or refrain from entering, any trade union, or to withdraw from, or to refrain from withdrawing from, his membership of a trade union of which he is a member, as a condition of his employment;
- b. dismiss a workman by reason only of his membership of a trade union or of his engaging in trade union activities;
- c. give any inducement or promise to a workman to prevent him from becoming, or continuing to be, a member, office - bearer or representative of a trade union;
- d.       prevent a workman from -
5. (i)                 forming a trade union; or
6. (ii) supporting a trade union by financial or other means;
- e.      interfere with the conduct of the activities of a trade union;
- f.        dismiss, or otherwise take disciplinary action against, any workman or office bearer of a trade union -
- i.            for any statement made by such workman or office-bearer in good faith before any tribunal or person in authority; or
- ii.            for any statement regarding acts or omissions of the employer relating to the terms and conditions of employment, of the members of such trade union made by such workman or office  bearer,  in  pursuance  of  an  industrial  dispute  for  the  purpose  of  securing  redress  or amelioration of working conditions of such members;
- g.      refuse to bargain with a trade union which has in its membership not less than forty per centum of the workmen on whose behalf such trade union seeks to bargain

An association  or  combination  consisting  of  judicial  officers,  members  of  the  armed  forces,  police officers, prison officer's members any corps established under the Agricultural Corps Ordinance shall, notwithstanding  anything  in  its  objects,  be  deemed  not  to  be  a  trade  union  and  nothing  in  this Ordinance shall apply to, or in relation to, any such association or combination. [Sec. 20(2)].

## 6. Employment Provident Fund

The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) was established under the EPF Act No.15 of 1958 (Act) as a mandatory defined contribution retirement scheme for private and semi-government sector employees who do not enjoy pension benefits. As the largest superannuation fund in Sri Lanka, EPF managed an asset base of Rs. 2,824 billion at the end of 2020. 19 It  is  Sri  Lanka's  biggest  and most popular social security program. With such a huge asset base, the EPF offers some "Peace of Mind" for workers at private  sector  companies,  state-sponsored  corporations,  statutory  boards,  and  privately  owned businesses.

The EPF's objectives are to guarantee employees financial security throughout their retirement years and to recognize them for their contributions to the nation's economic development. The vision of EPF is to  be  the  most  caring  superannuation  fund  in  the  region,  enabling our  members to  have  a  content retirement life. The mission of EPF is to provide maximum retirement benefits and efficient service to our members through prudent and innovative fund management.

Part 1 of the EPF Act stipulates the establishment and membership of the employees' provident fund and  administration  of  the  Act  and  such  fund.  In  terms  of  Section  4  (1)  of  the  EPF  Act,  the Commissioner of Labor acts as the general administrator of the Fund. At the same time, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is entrusted with the powers, duties, and responsibilities to act as the custodian of the Fund as stipulated by Section 05 of the EPF Act. The Employees' Provident Fund Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka manages the money, while the Department of Labor is in charge of the EPF's administrative operations.

According to the EPF Act, an employee must contribute a minimum of 8%, and an employer must contribute  a  minimum  of  12%  of  the  employee's  monthly  salary's  total  earnings.  Employees'  EPF balances increase over time as they gain experience in their workplaces. The Central Bank invests the total  amount  in  Treasury  Bonds,  Treasury  Bills,  Equity  Securities,  Corporate  Debt  Securities,  and Money Market Instruments to preserve the EPF account balance. The yearly interest rate is announced and credited to the employ ees' accounts based on the rate of return. As a result, an employee's EPF contribution is placed in safe, yearly-growing assets, providing them peace of mind that they will be secure and able to safeguard their families.

Part III of the EPF Act deals with the Benefits. Section 23 states that EPF members are eligible to claim their retirement benefits (contributions and accumulated interest) upon reaching the retirement age of 50 years for females and 55 years for males. In addition, members are entitled to withdraw funds from their EPF accounts in the events of migration, permanent disability, leaving the employment due to marriage  (only  for  female  members),  and  joining  pensionable  employment.  Further,  legal  heirs  of deceased members are eligible to receive the benefits in the case of the death of a member.

In addition to the retirement benefits, as per the section 23A of the EPF (Amendment) Act No.02 of 2012, members who have service of more than ten years and an EPF account balance of more than Rs.300,000 are entitled to withdraw up to 30 per cent of the amount lying to the credit in their member accounts with EPF for house construction or medical treatment with effect from 2015. As per the above said Amendment, EPF facilitates members to obtain loans for housing purposes from five approved lending institutions by pledging the balances lying to the credit of their member accounts with EPF. EPF (Amendment) Act 2012 section 31B stated that it shall be the duty of every employer having in his employment a minimum of fifty employees to furnish a monthly return containing such particulars as may be prescribed to the Commissioner-General of Labor with a copy to the Central Bank not later than the end of the succeeding month. Finally, arrangements have been made to 'provide the services of the EPF Department by post, e-mail, internet or through the branches of commercial banks due to the travel  restrictions  imposed  in  the  country  without  requiring  the  member  to  visit  the  head  office  in Colombo and regional offices of the Central Bank to obtain the respective services.' .

Further,  section  6  of  the  Act stipulates that ' where a collective agreement in respect of any industry in any district has been reduced to writing and signed by both the parties to the agreement or by the representative of each party thereto, any such party or any trade union or employer constituting or included in any such party may transmit the agreement to the Commissioner; and the Commissioner shall forthwith cause the agreement to be published in the Gazette. ' The section also provides ' that where such agreement contains provisions relating  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment  of  any  workmen  in  such  industry,  the Commissioner shall not cause such agreement to be so published unless he is satisfied that those terms and conditions are not less favourable than those applicable to any other workmen in the same or similar industry in such district. ' For this section, ' terms and conditions of employment set out in any other collective agreement shall not be deemed to be applicable to any workmen unless the agreement has been published in the Gazette under this section and is, for the time being, in force. '

Section  7  sets  out  the  date  on  which  the  collective  agreement  comes  into  force  and  its  duration.

' [Section 10].
